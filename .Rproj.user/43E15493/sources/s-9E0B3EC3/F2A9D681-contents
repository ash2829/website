        <h3>Hi ya'll! I'm <strong>{{ .Site.Params.author }}</strong>, an undergraduate student at UT Austin studying biology. I'm currently taking the pre-med route as I have a great aspiration to attend medical school in hopes of becoming a pediatric surgeon. I dream of one day, making a difference in my community and being a role model to young Latina's pursuing a career in the medical field.</h3>
