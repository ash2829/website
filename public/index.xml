      <description>Alexis Hernandez ash2829 0. Introduction The datasets I have chosen are named fifa_audience and drinks which contain data representing information on a FIFA audience sample and alcohol servings in different countries, respectively. The first dataset contains detailed data on how wide an audience the World Cup reached on television in different countries. The variables include the FIFA viewers country, the confederation of the country, the country’s share of the global population, the country’s share of the World Cup’s television audience, and the country’s GDP-weighted audience share.</description>
